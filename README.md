# [Blocitoff](https://blocitoff-nate.herokuapp.com/)
---
### A self-destructing TO-DO list app with rake automation.
Built with Ruby on Rails using TDD, Continuous Integration, and the [Interactor design pattern](http://eng.joingrouper.com/blog/2014/03/03/rails-the-missing-parts-interactors)


---
## The Process
Blocitoff was created as part of the [Bloc](http://bloc.io) curriculum. It was a very open-ended project with minimal instruction; guidance came in the form of [user stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) and regular code reviews with my instructor.

### An example user story
>As a user, I want to sign up for a free account by providing a user name, password and email

This particular project focuses on back-end techniques. The Boostrap UI/UX design is just enough to be functional and support the underlying functionality.
