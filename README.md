# [Blocitoff](https://blocitoff-nate.herokuapp.com/)
---
### A self-destructing TO-DO list app with rake automation.
Built with Ruby on Rails using TDD, Continuous Integration, and the [Interactor design pattern](http://eng.joingrouper.com/blog/2014/03/03/rails-the-missing-parts-interactors)


---
## Usage
1. Visit the Heroku app: [Blocitoff](https://blocitoff-nate.herokuapp.com/)
2. Either:

  a. Sign up for an account by clicking `"sign up"` and confirming your email, or...

  b. Log in using these credentials and poke around --
  ```
  username: admin@blocitoff.com
  password: helloworld
  ```

## The Process
Blocitoff was created as part of the [Bloc](http://bloc.io) curriculum. It was a very open-ended project with minimal instruction; guidance came in the form of [user stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) and regular code reviews with my instructor.

#### An example user story
>As a user, I want to sign up for a free account by providing a user name, password and email

#### Additional plans

This particular project focuses on back-end techniques. The user stories and requirements prioritize functionality over beauty. For simplicity, the original app used very basic Bootstrap styling.

However, as this app serves as a nice test subject, I have been and will continue to update the front-end appearance and functionality. As of 2/2016 Bootstrap has been removed and I've started re-writing the views sans-framework. There are [issues](https://github.com/npauzenga/Blocitoff/issues) but new features and styling will come soon.
